			Don't tell me anything. Now Biff, don't con me. Bet your ass it works. Looks like a airplane, without wings. Alright, good-bye Einy. Oh, watch that re-entry, it's a little bumpy.

			Good morning, Mom. Oh, Marty, I almost forgot, Jennifer Parker called. Great Scott. Let me see that photograph again of your brother. Just as I thought, this proves my theory, look at your brother. Yeah I know, If you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. How could I have been so careless. One point twenty-one gigawatts. Tom, how am I gonna generate that kind of power, it can't be done, it can't. C'mon, Mom, make it fast, I'll miss my bus. Hey see you tonight, Pop. Woo, time to change that oil.

			That's true, Marty, I think you should spend the night. I think you're our responsibility. Are you okay? Of course I do. Just a second, let's see if I could find it. Like I always told you, if you put your mind to it you could accomplish anything. I don't know, I can't keep up with all of your boyfriends.

			That Biff, what a character. Always trying to get away with something. Been on top of Biff ever since high school. Although, if it wasn't for him- I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. Unfortunately no, it requires something with a little more kick, plutonium. What, well you mean like a date? You want it, you know you want it, and you know you want me to give it to you.

			He's absolutely right, Marty. the last thing you need is headaches. What? This is more serious than I thought. Apparently your mother is amorously infatuated with you instead of your father. Doc, Doc. Oh, no. You're alive. Bullet proof vest, how did you know, I never got a chance to tell you. About all that talk about screwing up future events, the space time continuum. George.
